# TeamBot

**Autonomous AI Agent Teams for Software Development**

TeamBot is a CLI tool that uses the [GitHub Copilot SDK](https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk) to enable collaborative, multi-agent AI workflows. Instead of single-threaded AI interactions, TeamBot orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents that work together autonomously to achieve development objectives.
